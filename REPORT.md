I spent approximately 5 hours on this project
The most challenging aspect of this project was the architecture design. I am usually working on an already existing basis vs starting from scratch.

I tried to build a 3 layers architecture (Data Access / Service / Controller), but the request was to create a function and not an endpoint.

I stopped after completing level 3 due to a lack of time.
Unit tests and error management has not been completed.
I runned and tested the function with multiple business cases.
